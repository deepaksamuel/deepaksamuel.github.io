                          <p>The TIPP conference series, the science driven cross-disciplinary conference, started in Tsukuba, Japan in 2009 (TIPP 2009), followed by Chicago in 2011 (TIPP 2011), Amsterdam in 2014 (TIPP2014), Beijing in 2017 (TIPP2017), Canada in 2021 (TIPP2021) and South Africa in 2023 (TIPP2023). The conference aim is to provide a stimulating atmosphere for scientists and engineers from around the world. The 2021 edition will take place virtually. The conference will, as in the past, include plenary invited talks and parallel tracks with contributions outlining state-of-the-art developments in different areas. The program focus is on all areas of detector development and instrumentation in particle physics, astro-particle physics and closely related fields, in particular:

</p>

<h2>Local Transport</h2>

<p>Mumbai is well connected by a network of metro, bus, rail and taxi servces.

<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>December to February is the beginning of the best season of the year and is generally dry with day/night temperatures between 15-25 °C. The northern parts of the country become much cooler with the temperature going below 5 °C during the night.
</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>
Mumbai is a 'mega city' and one of the largest metropolitan regions in India. It is the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of the country. Thanks to its liberal cosmopolitan nature, Mumbai has attracted large number of migrants from India as well as from abroad belonging to diverse social and religious groups. It is truly a melting pot of all cultures.

It may be noted that like many other Asian countries India is a conservative country. In particular, public displays of affection are frowned upon for couples and may garner an unwelcome attention. Homosexuality is technically illegal. Despite that, there are active LGBT communities in India and Mumbai in particular. For more details, please see:
http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/gay-and-lesbian-travellers.

As in any other large and crowded city there are opportunistic thieves in operation but not at an alarmingly high rate. Please take care of your belongings and do not wander into seemingly deserted areas late at night.		
</p>
<h2>Tourism</h2>
<p>Maharashtra attracts tourists from other Indian states and foreign countries. It was the second most visited Indian state by foreigners and fifth most visited state by domestic tourists in the country in 2024.
