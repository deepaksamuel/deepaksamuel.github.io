        <p>Particle physics deals with the structure of matter at the smallest scale, while cosmology studies the entire universe on the largest scales.  Although these two diverse fields are separated by the scales of the objects they study, they need each other to explain the evolution of our universe just after it got created 13.7 billion years ago. In this talk, using the knowledge we acquired at particle physics laboratories, I plan to explore the universe when it was only a fraction of a second old.

        <p>A variety of astronomical observations indicate that objects
          such as planets, stars, galaxies, etc. that we "see" in the Universe
          account for only about 5% of the total matter and energy content of the
          Universe. The other 95% is made up of some unknown form of invisible
          matter called "Dark Matter" (about 25%) and an unknown form of energy
          called "Dark Energy" (70%). This talk will discuss how scientists have
          used basic principles of physics to arrive at such an astonishing
          conclusion about the Universe we inhabit and how they are trying to
          uncover the mystery of this Invisible Universe. </p>

        <p>Rare phenomena, events and processes have always been challenging physicists to question the
          foundations of physics. Quite often, such intriguing situations can be logically arrived at through
          physical arguments, large scale observations, theoretical model building, followed by mathematical
          derivations having different levels of difficulties. These pose challenges to the physicists to prove or
          disprove them with experimental findings which are often difficult and daunting tasks to accomplish.
          Many of the Mega Science projects are aimed at such endeavours. A few such examples will be
          presented in this talk with aim to motivate the young physicists to take up the challenges in future.</p>

        <p>Neutrinos, uncharged weakly-interacting fundamental particles, are of three types and were thought to be
          massless till recently. They have been found to exhibit the unusual feature of oscillating from one type to
          another as they travel. The way this was observed in the last few decades in a few clever experiments around
          the world will be highlighted. We discuss how this is a signal for a non-zero mass of the neutrinos. Then, we
          briefly touch upon a major experiment â€“ the India-based Neutrino Observatory -- that is being set up in India
          to address some of the open issues. We end with a discussion of why a non-zero mass of the neutrino has
          important physics implications.</p>

        <p>The above equation drives most of the neutrino oscillation experiments worldwide. Nature has fixed some of
          the parameters in the equation while giving us the liberty to change others.
          In the context of neutrino oscillations, what are the unknowns, what are the knowns and how do we make the
          unknowns known, will form the crux of my talk. The talk is aimed at beginners with knowledge of basic
          mathematics.

            <p>Particle detectors or radiation detectors are used to detect the charged particles and uncharged
              radiation produced in a high-energy physics (HEP) experiment or in cosmic radiation. Gaseous detectors are
              the first electrical devices developed for radiation detection. Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC), Gas
              Electron Multiplier (GEM), Straw tube are some advanced gas filled detectors used in present experiments.
              In this talk some features and applications of some important gaseous detectors and scintillation
              detectors used in current HEP experiments will be addressed. The fun and career in detector R&D will also
              be discussed.

            <p>Neutrinos are very tiny particles, which roam almost freely through the entire universe.
              Therefore it is very difficult to detect them and study their behaviour.
              Neutrinos were first discovered through study of atomic nuclei.
              This talk will give a glimpse of how one can learn about neutrinos by searching for a very rare nuclear
              decay process that does not emit neutrinos.
