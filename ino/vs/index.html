        <p>A variety of astronomical observations indicate that objects 
          such as planets, stars, galaxies, etc. that we "see" in the Universe 
          account for only about 5% of the total matter and energy content of the 
          Universe. The other 95% is made up of some unknown form of invisible 
          matter called "Dark Matter" (about 25%) and an unknown form of energy 
          called "Dark Energy" (70%). This talk will discuss how scientists have 
          used basic principles of physics to arrive at such an astonishing 
          conclusion about the Universe we inhabit and how they are trying to 
          uncover the mystery of this Invisible Universe.  </p>

          <p>Rare phenomena, events and processes have always been challenging physicists to question the
              foundations of physics. Quite often, such intriguing situations can be logically arrived at through
              physical arguments, large scale observations, theoretical model building, followed by mathematical
              derivations having different levels of difficulties. These pose challenges to the physicists to prove or
              disprove them with experimental findings which are often difficult and daunting tasks to accomplish.
              Many of the Mega Science projects are aimed at such endeavours. A few such examples will be
              presented in this talk with aim to motivate the young physicists to take up the challenges in future.</p>

        <p>Neutrinos, uncharged weakly-interacting fundamental particles, are of three types and were thought to be massless till recently. They have been found to exhibit the unusual feature of oscillating from one type to another as they travel. The way this was observed in the last few decades in a few clever experiments around the world will be highlighted. We discuss how this is a signal for a non-zero mass of the neutrinos. Then, we briefly touch upon a major experiment â€“ the India-based Neutrino Observatory -- that is being set up in India to address some of the open issues. We end with a discussion of why a non-zero mass of the neutrino has important physics implications.</p>

        <p>Neutrinos are very  tiny particles, which  roam almost freely through the entire universe. 
          Therefore it is very difficult to detect them and study their behaviour.
          Neutrinos were first discovered through study of atomic nuclei. 
          This talk will give a glimpse of how one can learn about neutrinos by searching for a very rare nuclear decay process that does not emit neutrinos.

        <p>The simple equation above drives most of the neutrino experiments worldwide. Nature has fixed some of the parameters in the equation while giving us the liberty of changing others.
          What are the unknowns, what are the knowns and how do we make the unknowns known will form the crux of my talk.  The talk is aimed at beginners with only basic understanding of mathematics.
