              <b>Prof. Satyajit Saha</b> was involved in establishing the Jaduguda Underground Science Laboratory
                  (JUSL), at the Jaduguda mines in Jharkhand. Currently, he is working on several experiments at JUSL
                  which involve background estimation, prototype experiments on dark matter and other rare event searches. Earlier in his research career, he has worked on
                  experiments relating to fundamental symmetry violation, nuclear spectroscopy and reactions of
                  fundamental physics interest, inner shell ionization phenomena in heavy elements, etc. He has wide
                  experience in radiation detector development and related instrumentation intended for
                  experiments in nuclear and high energy physics. He is currently <em>Raja Ramanna fellow</em> at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata</span>       
   
          <p>Rare phenomena, events and processes have always been challenging physicists to question the
              foundations of physics. Quite often, such intriguing situations can be logically arrived at through
              physical arguments, large scale observations, theoretical model building, followed by mathematical
              derivations having different levels of difficulties. These pose challenges to the physicists to prove or
              disprove them with experimental findings which are often difficult and daunting tasks to accomplish.
              Many of the Mega Science projects are aimed at such endeavours. A few such examples will be
              presented in this talk with aim to motivate the young physicists to take up the challenges in future.</p>

Currently Professor Emeritus at the University of Calcutta,  he was earlier the <em>Sir Tarak Nath Palit Professor of Physics</em>. From 2005-2011 he was the Director of the Harish-Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad. He is a recipient of the <em>Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award</em> and the International Alumnus of the year 2005 of the University of Maryland. He is a Fellow of the three National Science Academies and has been awarded D.Sc.(h.c) by the University of Gour Banga and the University of North Bengal.</span>       
 
        <p>Neutrinos, uncharged weakly-interacting fundamental particles, are of three types and were thought to be massless till recently. They have been found to exhibit the unusual feature of oscillating from one type to another as they travel. The way this was observed in the last few decades in a few clever experiments around the world will be highlighted. We discuss how this is a signal for a non-zero mass of the neutrinos. Then, we briefly touch upon a major experiment â€“ the India-based Neutrino Observatory -- that is being set up in India to address some of the open issues. We end with a discussion of why a non-zero mass of the neutrino has important physics implications.</p>
